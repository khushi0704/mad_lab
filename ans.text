git pull fails and shows merge conflicts when the 
same file is updated  at both local repo and remote .

Though git pull automatically resolves conflicts on its own but sometimes when 
you change the same line at both ends (local and remote repo) you'll get merge conflicts 
so , just delete the heads at the local file and change , and commit .
