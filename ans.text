though git pull automatically resolves merge
conflicts in most cases , but it fails to do so when you have made 
changes in the same line / same part of the code at both local and 
remote repo . so , in that case , git pull throws merge conflict
error and you'll need to resolve it deleting the conflict markers 
and making changes in the local file such that it doesn't 
overlap with the change in remote repo and finally perform git pull
